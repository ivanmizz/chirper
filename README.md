# Chirper

A microblogging platform built using the php laravel framework and vuejs. This project is from the laravel bootcamp. The purpose was to learn the laravel framework while getting hands on. This app is still a working progress as I'll be adding more features ;) hopefully. 


## Deployment

Clone the repository then make sure you have the latest node, php, laravel and sqlite installed in your system. Change Directory into the project's folder and execute the following commands.

To start the backend server

```bash
  php artisan serve
```
To run the frontend
```bash
  npm run dev
```
Open localhost in your browser and register/login. :)
```bash
  http://localhost:8000
```


## Acknowledgements
